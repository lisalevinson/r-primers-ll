This is a rebooted version of the old RStudio/Posit Primers, now with Quarto and webR. It is based on the [original port](https://r-primers.andrewheiss.com/) adapted by [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com/) üôè, but is modified and updated to use the newer [quarto live](https://github.com/r-wasm/quarto-live) quarto extension. The organization has been rearranged, styling changed, and currently only a subset of the primers are included in this version.

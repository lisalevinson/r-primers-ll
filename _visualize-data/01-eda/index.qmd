This tutorial will show you how to explore your data in a systematic way, a task that statisticians call **exploratory data analysis**, or **EDA** for short. In the tutorial you will:

* Learn a strategy for exploring data
* Practice finding patterns in data
* Get tips about how to use different types of plots to explore data

The tutorial is excerpted from _R for Data Science_ by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by Oâ€™Reilly Media, Inc., 2016, ISBN: 9781491910399. You can purchase the book at [shop.oreilly.com](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do).
